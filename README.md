# Parameters or Privacy

This is the official repo for the Neurips 2022 paper 
**"Parameters or Privacy: A Provable Tradeoff Between Overparameterization and Membership Inference"** 
by Jasper Tan, Blake Mason, Hamid Javadi, and Richard G. Baraniuk.

The paper plots can be found in `figs`. To generate to those plots yourself, first download the following folder into `./data`: 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hwpaqugvhh24d7/AADowuEYbBapD4UuWPR15F0aa?dl=0. Then, run the scripts in `generate_figs`.

The data in the previous link was generated by the scripts in the `experiments` folder. These scripts can take multiple days to run.
To make them run more quickly, you can use a machine with many CPU cores and adjust the `num_procs` variable accordingly.
I have provided the data in the Dropbox link in the previous folder, so that you do not have to run the experiments again to generate the paper plots.
